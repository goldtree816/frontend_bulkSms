# Dashboard
-> For now I haven't created a SignUp and login page to register and login user.
-> Any one can visit the dashboard directly form the landing page choosing the Dashboard option in the navigation bar.
-> In user dashboard only one option in the side bar is functional that is Report, where a user can view the report of the activities done.
